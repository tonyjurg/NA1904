## Feature description

In the context of a corpus, the term "monad" refers to a unit of textual analysis or a discrete linguistic unit. Specifically, in this Text-Fabric dataset, it is employed to denote the sequence number of an individual word within the entire corpus, specifically the New Testament.

## Note

The values for feature `monad` in this Text-Fabric dataset match with the ones found in [BibleOL](https://learner.bible/text/show_text/nestle1904) The monad values are not shown by default, but can be examined from the HTML source (in section `id="togglemql"`). More details can be found in [techdoc.tex](https://github.com/EzerIT/BibleOL/blob/master/techdoc/techdoc.tex).

## Source description
