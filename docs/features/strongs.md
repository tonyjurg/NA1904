Feature description: Strongs number.

Note from [biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904](https://github.com/biblicalhumanities/Nestle1904/tree/master/morph):
> The Strong's number. This has one of two formats: Either a single Strong's number in base 10, or two numbers separated by an ampersand (ASCII 0x26, i.e., "&"). In the latter case, the first number is the Strong's number, and the second number is a so-called "Tense Voice Mood" number, or "TVM number". The TVM number was popularized by Dr. Robinson's analyses of various texts, and was probably first used in the Online Bible. The TVM numbers are not further described here, and in any case, the morphological tags should always be consulted over and above the TVM number. No effort has been made to keep the TVM numbers in sync with the morphological tags, nor are TVM numbers always provided for a verb.
