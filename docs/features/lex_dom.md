# Feature: lex_dom

Datatype: `string`

Available for nodetype(s): [`word`](wordnodefeatures.md)

Feature description: Lexical domain according to Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Greek (SDBG).

Feature lex_dom is equivalent to a numerical representation of feature [ln](ln.md) using the following mapping: For example 
lex_domain = "089007" should be split into "087" and "007". The second number should be interpreted as a alphabetic (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, etc.). Taken together this maps to section 89G in Louw-Nida, which is the main section [relations](https://www.laparola.net/greco/louwnida.php?sezmag=89) and subsection [Cause and/or Reason](https://www.laparola.net/greco/louwnida.php?sezmag=89&sez1=15&sez2=38)
