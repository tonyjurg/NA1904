# Difference between the 1904 and the 1913 edition

Observation by Saulo de Oliveira CantanhÃªde:

> In the introduction of the 1913 version, Mark 1:1 was added to the category of "a passage for which ancient authority is in part wanting" (labeled with the symbols /< />), as John 5:3, 4 and John 7:53-8:11 were marked as well.
